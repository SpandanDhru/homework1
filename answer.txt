What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

The difference between a merge and a rebase is that a rebase creates a new set of commits applied on 
top of the target branch. This gives a more linear history but is less informative. A merge creates 
a new merge commit that combines the changes from both branches, preserving the original branch history.
It results in a more branched history.

What is a remote repository?

Basically, a remote repository is a centralized storage location for code in
version control systems such as Git. It allows for collaboration by allowing
multiple developers to upload and download code changes from a shared location.
This makes sure that there is a central copy of the project and that things like
version history is maintained. It faciltates team collaboration and is some
prime are GitHub and GitLab.
